Welcome to my project:

## In order to run:
1. go to repo Poke_project
1. enter in the terminal " npm start "
2. this will open a window on port 4000
3. in order to test the cookies, you can use port 3000 on a diffrent browser (cookies remembers your favorite pokemon (s))

## In order to build the database:
 ** no need to build it, it works great. building again creates unnecessary traffic in the api **

1. go to repo Poke_project
2. enter in the terminal " node makeJSON.js"
 

## Feature:
 - Search engine
 - Cookie based favorite pokemon selector
 - A http server with 2 ports
 - Reactive layout

 ### Things to add
 - support for evolution trees
 - better single pokemon page UI
 - better naming and file management
